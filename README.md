## In progress:

* Making it varying size, currently 10x8 grid


### Running
It shows the the number of mines, including negative.
if you type `make` it will build but make sure to have bin and src folders.
Edit the makefile if some flags are wrong.
```console
make run
```
will start the program

**Made for mac, not cross-platform**
