# Minesweeper
Making minesweeper like the old Win98 style using SDL2 and C

<img src="/img/mine.jpg" alt="19 mines remaining" width="300">

## In progress:

* Getting the timer functioning
* Stopping the game when i hit a mine
* Showing hit mines red when I press them
* Making the mines have the correct graphics with correct logic
* Refining the graphics and getting a border
* Making it varying size, currently 10x8 grid


### Running

so far i have some debugging statements, and printing in the terminal
the number of mines. if you type `make` it will build the progress, and edit the makefile if some flags are wrong. `make run` will start the program
