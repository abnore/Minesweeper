## In progress:

* Making it varying size, currently 16x16 grid


### Running
It shows the the number of mines, including negative.

```console
make
```
the macro `BOMB_CHANCE` set the chance of a cell being a bomb. The lower this number,
the more bombs you will get.

```console
make run
```
will start the program

**Made for mac, not cross-platform**
